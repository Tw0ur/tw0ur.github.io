<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Impact;font-size:27px;">ABAY KUNANBAYEV is a great philosopher and esthete of a new type. Some researchers accept his “Words of Edification” as an integral philosophical treatise. He is a genius who managed to give new content to the problems of the meaning of life and work. Abai taught that only labor is a storehouse of all wealth, only labor brings pleasure. His aphorism “And you are like a brick in this world, find your place in it” shows the new content of Kazakh life. Abay brought a new ideal to the Kazakhs, which is based on labor: a person is distinguished by knowledge and diligence, and not by wealth and a lot of livestock. Or rather, you can’t accumulate them without difficulty.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Georgia;font-size:27px;">Abay was born on August 10, 1845 in the Vingiz mountains of the Semipalatinsk region (according to the current administrative case) from one of the four wives of Kunanbay, the senior sultan of the Karkaralinsky district department. Abai's family was hereditarily aristocratic, and grandfather (Oskenbay) and great-grandfather (Irgizbay) dominated their family as rulers and biys. He was lucky in the sense of family comfort and home education, since both Ulzhan's mother and grandmother were inherently charming and gifted by nature. It is with the passage of time that the hands of matter spend the name &quot;Ibrahim&quot; was replaced by the caressing &quot;Abay&quot;, which means &quot;cautious, thoughtful.&quot; Under this name, he lived his whole life and went down in history. Started in early childhood, familiarization with the oral art of the people and home education from the mullah was continued in the madrasah of Imam Ahmed-Riza. At the same time, he studied at a Russian school and by the end of his five-year studies began to write poetry. From the age of 13, Kunanbai began to accustom Abai to the administrative activities of the head of the clan. He had to delve into inter-tribal litigation, quarrels, intrigues, and gradually he became disillusioned with administrative and political activities, which led to the fact that at the age of 28 Abay departed from it, completely engaged in self-education. But only by the age of 40 did he realize his vocation as a poet and citizen, in particular, putting his name under the poem &quot;Summer&quot; (previously he attributed his compositions to his friend Dzhantasov Kokpai). A significant impulse in revealing the high potentialities of Abai at that moment was his communication with exiled Russians, with E.P. Michaelis, N. Dolgopolov, S. Gross. Abay's appeal to Russian culture, which experienced in the XIX century. its period of &quot;storm and onslaught&quot; in literature and art, turned out to be all the more natural because in the Eastern tradition the poetic word was highly valued. Abai was close to the poetry of Pushkin, Lermontov, Goethe and Byron. In his translations into Kazakh, he subtly conveyed the spirit of the translated verses and adapted them to the worldview of his fellow tribesmen. For 20 years, the genius of Abai has flourished in an extremely diversified way, he has gained extraordinary prestige, huge popularity that has never been seen in the steppe before. Akyns, singers, composers flock to him, talented youth crowd around him, a socio-philosophical and literary school is being created. But Abay, as the ruler of thoughts, causes wild envy, furious anger, manifested in the most insidious forms. The last blows of fate are connected with the death of Abdrakhman and Magavia. He rejected the treatment of the disease and voluntarily doomed himself to death. He was buried near his winter quarters in the Zhidebai Valley, near the Chingiz Mountains, at the age of 60. It is impossible to fully understand the tragic feeling of loneliness experienced by Abay without taking into account two circumstances. The first and most fundamental circumstance is the impulse to transform the culture of the people, which Abay gave. First of all, we are talking about verbal culture, about poetic tradition. The Kazakh specificity of folklore, despite its traditional character, did not exclude individual creativity even before Abai, as evidenced by the preserved names of akyns, singers, storytellers, composers, improvisers, masters of poetic competition. Abay brought a completely new quality to all this. He poured into the culture of the Kazakhs a whole stream of images, forms (satire, lyrics, revelations, landscape lyrics, confession), plots, ideas from other cultures and traditions, which meant the inclusion of Kazakh culture in the world of a large culture of classical civilizations and the inculcation of the spiritual experiences characteristic of the latter to the traditional Kazakh culture. Among these foreign cultures is the Arab culture in its largest documents such as the Koran and the Thousand and One Nights, and with it the Hellenistic tradition of Aristotle and Alexander the Great. Then the thousand-year-old Persian culture and literature, which, in the tradition of the Abay family, entered his consciousness from childhood and was fixed by a conscious appeal to the work of Firdousi, Saadi, Nizami, Navoi, Fizuli. The world of Russian culture in connection with European culture and European tradition was completely new, hitherto unknown to the Kazakhs before Abai. But the basis of the perception of the West is a deeply conscious East, adherence to Islam. There are stories that fate itself is destined to roam. Like the myth of the one-eyed monster, transported from the steppe to the Mediterranean in the form of Homer's Polyphemus, one of Goethe's plots through the Russian plains reached the steppe nomads in the form of well-known poems set to music by Abai. Lermontov translated Goethe's &quot;Night Song of the Wanderer&quot;, and Abay pushed off from this in his elegy &quot;Karangy tunde tau kalgyp&quot;. Such completely different cultural layers were organically implemented by Abay and organically grafted onto the tree of the Kazakh tradition. It is in this creative fusion that Abay's strength, the power of his cultural impact, the incomparable nationwide creativity, is incomparable. The similarity of Kazakh songwriting with operatic art is surprising, but it becomes quite understandable in the context of Abai's improvisations. What has been said about Abai's contribution to Kazakh culture will not be completely logical if we do not mention that Abai's work is not limited to the surviving texts and melodies, but includes the powerful influence of his personality. He acted as an adviser, storyteller, unobtrusive mentor, teacher, organizer of an unofficial school of talented writers, an educator who, in conversations, in conversations, generously shared what he had read, thought out. All of the above, it would seem, speaks of a strong indissoluble creative connection with the environment, with the people , about the oncoming streams of sympathy and responses, excluding the very possibility of tragic loneliness. But life, as our Zoroastrian ancestors rightly noted, does not consist of only bright beginnings, there is a place in it for the dark forces of evil, which tirelessly strive to destroy the good. Previously, such situations were explained quite simply, which bribed the minds of inexperienced and even sophisticated people. It was said, for example, that there were tsarist administrators who did not like the satire and criticism of Abay, his connection with political exiles. There is a local ruling elite who hated Abai for his love and compassion for the disadvantaged. An excellent scheme, but too simplified and far from life. In it, in life, everything is much more complicated and scary. After all, it was rightly said in antiquity that &quot;there is no prophet in his own country.&quot; His haters and ill-wishers, petty envious people and &quot;big people from the top&quot; who traditionally consider themselves &quot;rulers of thoughts&quot; closed in a dense ring around Abai. A truly great man, a &quot;noble man,&quot; and he remains as opposed to, in the words of Confucius, &quot;little men.&quot; It is necessary to imagine the Kazakh society of the Abai era as a whole. First of all, this is a colony with all the attributes of a mixture of imperial and colonial psychology, swagger, tyranny, sycophancy, arrogance, internal inferiority. But it is also a traditional society, where the whole life of a person is in plain sight, where a person is not left alone with his worries and experiences, but they will try to get into the very soul, introduce seeds of suspicion and enmity, gossip into the immediate environment. Invisible to the human eye, an iceberg of incompatibility with true greatness, a big human heart, surfaced on the surface through police surveillance, investigation, hostile actions, up to an attempt on life, slander and denunciations. Truly, Lermontov was right: he rebelled against the opinions of the world alone, as before, and was killed. But the work of Abay, for all its tragedy, despite the vicissitudes of fate, despite all the haters, has firmly grown into the thickness of the people's consciousness and continues to feed it with fruitful impulses. The opponents of Abai failed to achieve the most terrible thing they wanted to achieve: to close the ring around the poet so that his word would remain unanswered. They miscalculated in the main. The word of Abai could not remain absolutely unheard. A special place in the work of Abai is occupied by &quot;Kara soz&quot;. Under this name, 45 &quot;Words&quot; are united - small finished fragments expressed in a carefully, artistically stylistically processed prose form. This is a direct appeal to the reader, a frank conversation - an interview, this is &quot;the mind of cold observations and the heart of sad remarks&quot;, this is the philosophy of the life of an individual against the backdrop of the fate of the people. The term &quot;kara&quot; (black) in combination with the term &quot;soz&quot; (word) is extremely ambiguous: it is also the designation of prose, in contrast to rhymed speech and text, it is also the designation of sadness, and, finally, the designation coming from the Turkic tradition, important, important, paramount&quot;Kara soz&quot; in genre is close to what in the Chingiz tradition was called &quot;bilik&quot;, a well-aimed saying, a story about a life example, which has the value of a model. According to the European tradition, this is the genre of &quot;maxims&quot;, &quot;aphorisms&quot;, &quot;conversations&quot;. But in fact &quot;Kara soz&quot; is a confession. Given in Russian, the title of this work &quot;Words of Edification&quot; sounds dryly moralistic, mentor-instructive. But one has to reckon with it as a statement in the face of the world and, above all, one's own conscience, a genre known in world literature since the time of Marcus Aurelius, Peter Abelard, Blaise Pascal and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. But for Turkic literature and Kazakh literature in particular, due to its predominantly epic nature, - but not only - the &quot;uncovering of the soul&quot; found in the &quot;Words of Edification&quot; is an unprecedented phenomenon. Confession is an extremely responsible genre. He demands the utmost honesty and sincerity from the writer; the slightest falsity and pretense are contraindicated here. Abai wants his voice not to be the voice of one crying in the wilderness. The outline of the narrative begins with a seemingly purely individual beginning: &quot;Have I lived well until today, but not a little has been passed ... But when the end of the path is already visible, when I am exhausted and tired of my soul, I am convinced of the futility of my good aspirations, of the vanity and frailty of human life.&quot; This is how Abai sums up his own life and explains the decision to write down &quot;his thoughts&quot;. &quot;Maybe someone will like some of my words and he will rewrite it for himself or just remember it, and if not, my words, as they say, will remain with me.&quot; But the tragedy of the situation is not in the usual maxim about the frailty of life and its inherent vanity. “Although I exist, I am truly dead. I can’t figure out what the reason is: either in impotent annoyance at my relatives, or in rejection from myself, or in something else. In appearance, I am quite healthy, inside &quot;I'm dead. Whether I laugh, I don't feel joy. Whatever I do, whether I speak, whether I laugh - it's all as if it's not mine at all, but someone else.&quot; Abay throws aside any external circumstances and the conversation starts on the essence of those values ​​and guidelines that lead the Kazakhs to a dead end: false conceit in superiority over others, idleness, laziness, individualism and groupism, petty vanity, sneer and stupid laughter, loss of conscience and lofty aspirations, lack of consent and unity, reverence for thieves, villains and swindlers ... Where did he enter the blood of the &quot;proud steppe&quot; a host of these bad qualities? And is it &quot;my people, whom I love and to whose heart I am looking for a path?&quot; Therefore, in the mentioned ninth Word, it is not just about personal spiritual well-being, but about the state and destinies of the people“I don’t understand,” writes Abay, “how I feel about my people… do I dislike them or love them?” “If I loved them, I would have approved their morals without the slightest doubt and among all the traits I would have found at least one worthy of praise. My love would not let the faith go out that my compatriots have the qualities inherent in a great nation, but I don’t have this faith. accumulated by history &quot;Who poisoned Socrates, burned Joan of Arc, crucified Christ?&quot; asks the poet. - The crowd. So the crowd has no mind. the need for culture and self-education must arise.All these processes will require purposefulness, one cannot jump to the heights of culture in one fell swoop.A person must at least free himself from the need for daily bread, because only as an exception, in the rarest case, is someone able to overcome all the obstacles that lock a person in the struggle for existence. The main thing in the learning process is that it should bring the student the joy of learning. The poet protests against &quot;violence on the part of parents and mullahs who kill sincerity in children.&quot; Abai promotes the path of familiarization with European culture, tested by him, as a universally significant way of familiarizing with the achievements of European civilization. &quot;Knowing the Russian language means opening your eyes to the world,&quot; Abai says in Word 25&quot;Knowledge of a foreign language and culture makes a person equal with this people, he feels at ease, and if the worries and struggle of this people are to his heart, then he will never be able to stay away.&quot; Starting from the general rule that one who is able to perceive a foreign culture takes a step towards a broader view of the world, learns self-criticism and overcomes limitations, Abay once again insists: &quot;Russian science and culture is the key to understanding the world and, having acquired it, can make life easier for our people. For example, we would learn different, but at the same time honest ways of earning a livelihood and instruct children on this path, we would more successfully fight for the equal position of our people among other peoples of the earth. &quot;It is at the end of this phrase, in the call to fight for&quot; equal position of our people among other peoples&quot; lies the deepest root of the fact that the generation of intellectuals following Abai, who united around Alash-Orda, perceived Abai as their spiritual forerunner, as the spiritual leader of the revival of the Kazakh nation. These are Alikhan Bukeikhanov, Mirzhakip Dulatov, Akhmet Baitursynov, Magzhan Zhumabaev, the whole brilliant galaxy of talented figures of the early and first third of the 20th century, destroyed by the ruthless hand of the Bolshevik oprichnina. Moving in line with the Abai heritage, the followers of Abai were able to raise it to a new height. First of all, they created a circle of intellectual communication, something that Abai lacked, who felt himself in a spiritual vacuum. Abay, like Valikhanov and Altynsarin, essentially acted alone, making individual efforts. Secondly, the successors of Abai's precepts linked general moral requirements with a specific political program for gaining independence and socio-economic progress. This height was lost during the years of the totalitarian regime. A return to it at a new stage in history, when Kazakhstan legally gained independence, would be the best monument to Abai.<br></span>
